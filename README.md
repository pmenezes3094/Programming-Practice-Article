## Version Control Best Practices

### What do you mean by Best Practices?

#### Commit Relatively:

-- A commit should be relative to the work, which means the commit should look understandable with the changes. It should not be a mess of the code. If a person is trying to solve multiple problems, then the commit also should be various means each commit shows the different issues solved. If one commits to delivering all the problems solved, that is not a good practice(https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/appendix/best-practices).

#### Commit small but often:

-- Committing code in small increments reduces the risk of integration conflicts. Regular, small commits and well-documented changes make it easier to revert if conflicts occur. Committing frequently helps keep changes small and focused, allowing for more regular sharing and integration with others. Infrequent, large commits create challenges in resolving disputes and understanding changes(https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/appendix/best-practices, https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/version-control-best-practices/).

### How you should commit every time?

#### Remember to not commit uncomplete work:

-- Only commit code to the repository when it is fully functional. This does not require you to complete a big feature before committing. However, it is recommended to split the implementation of the feature into smaller, manageable chunks and commit early and frequently to keep the code up to date(https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/appendix/best-practices).

### Why branches are important in best practices?

#### Use of Branches:

-- Branching is a crucial feature of Git, designed from the beginning to be quick and easy to use. It helps keep different lines of development separate and reduces confusion. To make the most of this feature, branches should be utilized in your development process for various tasks such as adding new features, fixing bugs, conducting experiments or exploring ideas(https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/appendix/best-practices).
